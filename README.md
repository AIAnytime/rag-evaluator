# RAG Evaluator

## Overview

RAG Evaluator is a Python library for evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. It provides various metrics to evaluate the quality of generated text against reference text.

## Installation

You can install the library using pip:

```bash
pip install rag-evaluator
```

## Usage

Here's how to use the RAG Evaluator library:

```python
from rag_evaluator import RAGEvaluator

# Initialize the evaluator
evaluator = RAGEvaluator()

# Input data
question = "What are the causes of climate change?"
response = "Climate change is caused by human activities."
reference = "Human activities such as burning fossil fuels cause climate change."

# Evaluate the response
metrics = evaluator.evaluate_all(question, response, reference)

# Print the results
print(metrics)
```

## Streamlit Web App

To run the web app:

1. cd into streamlit app folder.
2. Create a virtual env
3. Activate the virtual env
4. Install all dependencies
5. Run the app:
```
streamlit run app.py
```

## Metrics

The RAG Evaluator provides the following metrics:

1. **BLEU** (0-100): Measures the overlap between the generated output and reference text based on n-grams.
   - 0-20: Low similarity, 20-40: Medium-low, 40-60: Medium, 60-80: High, 80-100: Very high

2. **ROUGE-1** (0-1): Measures the overlap of unigrams between the generated output and reference text.
   - 0.0-0.2: Poor overlap, 0.2-0.4: Fair, 0.4-0.6: Good, 0.6-0.8: Very good, 0.8-1.0: Excellent

3. **BERT Score** (0-1): Evaluates the semantic similarity using BERT embeddings (Precision, Recall, F1).
   - 0.0-0.5: Low similarity, 0.5-0.7: Moderate, 0.7-0.8: Good, 0.8-0.9: High, 0.9-1.0: Very high

4. **Perplexity** (1 to âˆž, lower is better): Measures how well a language model predicts the text.
   - 1-10: Excellent, 10-50: Good, 50-100: Moderate, 100+: High (potentially nonsensical)

5. **Diversity** (0-1): Measures the uniqueness of bigrams in the generated output.
   - 0.0-0.2: Very low, 0.2-0.4: Low, 0.4-0.6: Moderate, 0.6-0.8: High, 0.8-1.0: Very high

6. **Racial Bias** (0-1): Detects the presence of biased language in the generated output.
   - 0.0-0.2: Low probability, 0.2-0.4: Moderate, 0.4-0.6: High, 0.6-0.8: Very high, 0.8-1.0: Extreme

7. **MOUVE** (0-1): MAUVE captures contextual meaning, coherence, and fluency while measuring both semantic similarity and stylistic alignment .
   -  0.0-0.2 (Poor), 0.2-0.4 (Fair), 0.4-0.6 (Good), 0.6-0.8 (Very good), 0.8-1.0 (Excellent).
     
8. **METEOR** (0-1): Calculates semantic similarity considering synonyms and paraphrases.
   - 0.0-0.2: Poor, 0.2-0.4: Fair, 0.4-0.6: Good, 0.6-0.8: Very good, 0.8-1.0: Excellent

9. **CHRF** (0-1): Computes Character n-gram F-score for fine-grained text similarity.
   - 0.0-0.2: Low, 0.2-0.4: Moderate, 0.4-0.6: Good, 0.6-0.8: High, 0.8-1.0: Very high

10. **Flesch Reading Ease** (0-100): Assesses text readability.
   - 0-30: Very difficult, 30-50: Difficult, 50-60: Fairly difficult, 60-70: Standard, 70-80: Fairly easy, 80-90: Easy, 90-100: Very easy

11. **Flesch-Kincaid Grade** (0-18+): Indicates the U.S. school grade level needed to understand the text.
    - 1-6: Elementary, 7-8: Middle school, 9-12: High school, 13+: College level

## Testing

To run the tests, use the following command:
